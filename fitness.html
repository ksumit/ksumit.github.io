    My Gym Fundae...

<p class="spacer"></p><h2>My fitness mantra<a href="#disclaimer" class="disclaimer">*</a></h2><p>I recently lost some 7kgs in 3 months. Thought it might be good to share with others; so here i go...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be regular to gym, work out every day. In first 6-8 weeks do as much cardio as possible. I started with treadmill at 8.5kmph, cycling at level 5 and 18 PI and steppers at level 6 (15 minutes each). This not only helped me loose the first few kgs really fast, but also helped me build stamina</li>
  <li>Take honey+hot water daily just before sleeping at night and atleast half an hour before breakfast in the morning. Honey helps in stimulating your metabolism rate and helps you loose unnecessary masses in your entire body. Few people complaint about weakness but my experience has been totally opposite. I felt more energetic and inspired with this practice.</li>
  <li>Find a good trainer. A trainer can make your workout really interesting and can help you reach higher levels really smoothly and fast. Having said that, have patience with your body and workout routine and trust your trainer. If trainer is not doing enough, keep increasing levels/speed whenever you feel you are already comfortable with present levels. Problem with human body is that it adjusts itself really quickly to any conditions. So know that your body has limits but try to stretch as much as possible. Its slightly tough but people have done it and so can you!</li>
  <li>Have discipline in your diet and workout. Every posture counts and has its own purpose. My trainer is good for that matter and has been very strict but motivating for me. He challenges me every now and then and then its my turn to surprise him with results. I still remember the first time i did 2km in 10min on tread mill. He was not expecting this so early and got really excited when i told him about the milestone</li>
  <li>After 6-8 weeks once you feel comfortable with cardio, do start weights training. It helps in breaking the monotonicity, strengthens your muscles and helps you loose kgs even faster (ohh well, in the beginning atleast as long as there are extra kgs to loose fast) I was very sceptical about weights but the trainer got me started slowly and now i feel comfortable about it.</li>
  <li>Last but not the least enjoy your workouts, don't strain it beyond limits. Think about something that makes you feel happy or inspires you. I'd my inspiration to think about when i started. And i always tested my own limits in workouts... All thanks to my trainer and that inspiration. I still follow this mantra and it gets me going smoothly. :) Also remember one of my friends quote: "no pain, no gain..." :P</li>
</ul><h2>My fitness quotes</h2><p>These were some random thoughts that used to come to my mind and made me going through my gym routine. Now i look forward to each day and enjoy this routine...</p>
<ul>
  <li>No pain, no gain... - Harit Himanshu</li>
  <li>Human body is a powerhouse. Train it and it will respond to your wills and desires...</li>
  <li>Sooner or later, you will get what you want; so dream big and just persevere...</li>
  <li>If you persevere, nothing remains easy, nothing remains difficult; it just becomes normal... - Swapnil Marathe</li>
  <li>If you can't help yourself, no one else will...</li>
  <li>Keep testing yourself, with time everything changes; and so do you. By all means, try new things whenever you get a chance; if you succeed, you will be happy; if you fail, you will learn something...</li>
  <li>Challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what makes it meaningful.</li>
  <li>"Even if you are on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there."-Will Roger</li>
  <li>The best way to predict the future is to invent it.</li>
  <li>Milestones don't matter; if you enjoyed the journey from the last milestone; chances are you will enjoy the journey to the next one too.</li>
</ul>
