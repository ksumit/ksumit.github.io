  <blockquote><strong>Thesis title:</strong> An Intelligent Emergency Patient Monitoring System using distributed paradigms<br/><strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. A. K. Majumdar and Prof. J. Mukhopadhyay, Dept of Computer Sc. &amp; Engg., IIT Kharagpur<br/><strong>Summary:</strong> Implements an emergency patient monitoring system for heterogeneous set of devices (mobile phones, PocketPC etc) with intelligent notification mechanism. My architecture, based on mobile agents and tuplespaces, is able to provide unified content based notification service at the users' end, irrespective of their device type and corresponding device-specific limitations (storage, environment, UI, connection and computing capacity). The architecture is generic in its nature and can be used as a middleware to implement device-independent collaborative on-demand services. The Java based implementation provides platform independence and multiple choices for devices.

Imported several patches from open source into EMR's offerings. Improved processing performance for Hadoop and Hive by optimizing listing of input data on S3 and rename and delete of intermediate outputs. Improved performance of "msck repair table" for EMR <a href="http://hive.apache.org">Hive</a> 13 on S3 by 10x of standard Apache implementation, this was even 2x better in performance of EMR's private feature "alter table recover partitions". Made several internal improvements on Hive 13 release process for EMR.<br/>Implemented <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-kinesis.html">EMR Kinesis connector</a> (<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a>, <a href="http://hive.apache.org">Hive</a>, <a href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> and <a href="http://www.cascading.org/">Cascading</a>) and user facing samples to get started. Helped on-board several customers onto EMR using this connector. Implemented open source <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/kinesis-log4j-appender">Kinesis Log4J Appender</a>.<br/>Implemented several internal improvements for EMR as a platform. Implemented compression of logs that reduced the cost for logs and debugging by 10x.
